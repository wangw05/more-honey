# More-Honey Final Project Proposal

## Project Description

1. The dataset we will be working with is Honey Production in the USA.  This dataset shows honey production numbers and prices by state from 1998 to 2012.  The data was collected by the **National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture** and we accessed it using _kaggle.com_.

2. Our possible audiences are bee farmers, researchers, people who work in the honey industry, and anyone who might be affected by the rapid decline in honeybee population in 2006, which had lasting effects on the honey industry to this day.  Our target audience is stores and parties that buy honey from the honey farmers and then resell it as this data will be most useful for them.
